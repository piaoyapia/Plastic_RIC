## 7 classes of plastics defined by the RIC üê≥

The machine learning model was built with fastai. See kaggle for the used training set and a kernel.
Fastai Version used: 1.0.60 - App runs fine on render.com.
The model contains the following classes and can therefor determine between them:

1_polyethylene_PET; 2_high_density_polyethylene_PE-HD; 3_polyvinylchloride_PVC; 4_low_density_polyethylene_PE-LD; 5_polypropylene_PP; 6_polystyrene_PS; 7_other_resins; 8_no_plastic

The info about the plastics is supposed to be a starting point for further development.
