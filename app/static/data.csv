Polyethylene terephthalate - PET was first introduced in 1966. Polyesters are semi-crystalline thermoplastics with good mechanical properties, even at temperatures above 100°. They have an ivory, milky white appearance. They can also be processed for crystal-clear applications. PET is resistant to abrasion, has a high rigidity, good sliding and insulating properties. Chemical resistance to solvents and fuels is good, but linear polyesters are sensitive to hot water, steam, strong acids and lyes.§Polyester fibres (Polar Fleece), thermoformed sheet, strapping, soft drink bottles, tote bags, furniture, carpet, paneling and (occasionally) new containers. (See also: Recycling of PET bottles.)§Picked up through most curbside recycling programs.§PET is often used to manufacture disposable bottles. One possibility here is of course to use reusable bottles. The start-up 'Air-Up' recently offers the possibility of scenting water with aromatic substances, so that the impression is created that one drinks water with taste. This innovation is not only beneficial to the environment, but also to human health: there is no need to add sugar, and yet it is possible to drink water with taste.§is of category Polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

"High-density PE-HD - Polyethylene is one of the most important and common polymers. It can only be produced economically since the 1950s. Polyethylene has good mechanical properties, is relatively stiff and has a high elongation at break. A basic distinction is made between high-density polyethylene (PE-HD; high density) and low-density polyethylene (PE-LD; low density). The mechanical properties improve with increasing density and higher crystal content. Undyed polyethylene (PE-HD) is milky-white and matt.

In particular, HD-PE is used to store shampoo, detergents and other cosmetic products. One way of limiting HD-PE consumption is to avoid products with such packaging. For example, soap nuts can be used instead of detergent, shampoo and shower gel tabs instead of liquid products. Non-packaging shops now have a wide range of alternative products.§is of category High-density PE-HD.

PVC - Countless additives and admixtures make PVC an all-round material. Originally hard and brittle, the toughness of the material is varied with plasticizers and adjusted to the application. Since phthalates are not firmly bound in soft PVC, they evaporate and dissolve on contact with liquids or fats. They are suspected of causing infertility, obesity and diabetes and are therefore prohibited for baby articles and children's toys and are completely unthought of for the food sector.§Pipe, window profile, siding, fencing, flooring, shower curtains, lawn chairs, non-food bottles, and children's toys.§Extensively recycled in Europe;[citation needed] 481,000 tonnes in 2014 through Vinyl 2010 and VinylPlus initiatives.§PVC is used less frequently in everyday life because it contains toxic and carcinogenic substances. However, it is still used in construction. There are good alternative materials, especially for floor coverings: linoleum, for example, a material that can be produced from natural, renewable resources: Linseed oil, resins, wood flour, limestone, jute and environmentally friendly dyes. §is of category 3 - polyvinyl chloride. PVC can be rigid and flexible and is commonly used by the construction industry.§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/defined_pic_3.JPG§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/recycling_3.jpg§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/alternative_3.jpg
Low-density PE-LD - Polyethylene is one of the most important and common polymers. It can only be produced economically since the 1950s. Polyethylene has good mechanical properties, is relatively stiff and has a high elongation at break. A basic distinction is made between high-density polyethylene (PE-HD; high density) and low-density polyethylene (PE-LD; low density). The mechanical properties improve with increasing density and higher crystal content. Polyethylene (PE-LD) is transparent.§Plastic bags, six pack rings, various containers, dispensing bottles, wash bottles, tubing, and various molded laboratory equipment§LDPE is not often recycled through curbside programs, but some communities will accept it. Plastic shopping bags can be returned to many stores for recycling.§Among other things, PE-LD is used for squeezable bottles, such as those used for preserving sauces, honey, etc. In Germany, the German Beekeepers' Association has its own deposit jar system - a beautiful example of the simple way of avoiding unnecessary PE-LD. By switching to products from regional producers, not only the local beekeepers are strengthened, but also a trade that is responsible for the flowering of countless plants in our environment.§is of category 4. Low-density PE-LD is often used for plastic bags.§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/defined_pic_4.JPG§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/recycling_4.jpg§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/alternative_4.jpg
PP - Polypropylene was first introduced to the market in 1957. It is a particularly light plastic which, due to its large proportion of crystalline structure (60-70%), has high rigidity, strength and hardness. PP is very tough and dimensionally stable up to about 110°C. It has a high heat resistance, scratch and friction resistance. It has good resistance to chemicals, acids and chemical agents. PP has a whitish-matt and semi-transparent appearance. PP is one of the most cost-effective plastics.§Auto parts, industrial fibres, food containers, and dishware§Number 5 plastics can be recycled through some curbside programs.§PP is often used as plastic cutlery and tableware. From 2021 onwards, disposable plastic is to be phased out: The EU wants to ban disposable products, France has already started this year. Alternatives are already available, also coming from Germany: the company 'leef', for example, offers alternative products made from pressed palm leaves. The alternative products are fully biodegradable and can be sent to compost after use.§is of category 5 – Polypropylene can be used from autoparts to food container.§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/defined_pic_5.JPG§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/recycling_5.jpg§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/alternative_5.jpg
PS - Edward Simon discovered the principle of polymerization as early as 1835, when he succeeded in distilling styrene from the bark of the styrax tree. Industrial production began in 1930. To improve the properties of pure PS, especially to eliminate its brittleness, the starting compound can be mixed with additives such as butadiene and/or acrylonitrile. Polystyrene can be foamed - this material is known under the name Styropor (trade name).§Desk accessories, cafeteria trays, plastic utensils, coffee cup lids, toys, video cassettes and cases, clamshell containers, packaging peanuts, and insulation board and other expanded polystyrene products (e.g., Styrofoam)§Number 6 plastics can be recycled through some curbside programs.§PS unfortunately does not impress with its compatibility for health. The plastic releases styrene, which is suspected of being carcinogenic. According to bund.net, the recycling of PS is also difficult and the combustion of PS is problematic. Foamed PS is used in construction. Under certain circumstances, natural materials can be used: Hemp, cellulose, flax and wood soft fibres can possibly be alternatives. (Photo: Hemp)§is of category 6 – Polystyrene. PS can be solid or foamed. §https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/defined_pic_6.JPG§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/recycling_6.jpg§https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piaoyapia/Plastic_RIC/master/app/view/content-pics/alternative_6.jpg
other resins - The RIC 7 includes several plastics such as acrylic, nylon, polycarbonate and polylactic acid (a bioplastic also known as PLA), and multi-layer combinations of different plastics. What they all have in common is that they are theoretically recyclable, but in most countries they are recycled only occasionally, if at all. It is therefore important to avoid these plastics in particular if possible.§Bottles, plastic lumber applications, headlight lenses, and safety shields/glasses.§Number 7 plastics have traditionally not been recycled, though some curbside programs now take them.§'Other Plastics' subsumes various types of resins, which is why there can be hardly any talk of only one alternative in this context; instead, suitable alternatives must be found in each individual case. At the moment PLA (polylactic acid) is very popular with everyone who has a 3D-printer: mostly PLA or ABS filaments are used at home. In the meantime, however, there are also compostable filaments made of natural fibres such as hemp, for example. §is of type ‚other resins‘.
